# SaaS :fire: :fire: :fire:
## Student As A Service
SaaS is a Solution Built for the **DSC Solution Challenge 2020** that aims to empower Students and organizations looking to hire students by providing a powerful platform where students can flaunt their skills and various times of the week that they are available to work and organizations can posts related jobs.
This way, students can apply for jobs, and organizations can hire student with matching profile qualifications.

This repository holds the Front end code for the project that has two parts to it:
1) The Front end 
2) [The Back end](https://github.com/Iyiola-am/saas)

Submission should be graded based on the master branch. However, we are enthusiastic about this project and committed to improving the project beyond what we have at submission for the Solutions challenge. Hence, we would keep actively working on it on the **staging branch**. You can always check for recent updates on staging.

## Setup
This project currently uses firebase, ensure you have `firebase cli` installed.

Clone this reposotory
Navigate the the directory of this project on your terminal and run the command `firebase serve`

## Design
The designer did an amazing work on the look and feel of the app and he did write a UX case study for his design, you can find the UX case study [here](https://www.notion.so/Designing-Student-As-A-Service-Job-Board-DSC-Solution-Challenge-2020-e509fb81c89544f1a4b350c07556d1a6)

## Testing

The Web App has been hosted on firebase and can be accessed via the URL [https://stuass.works](https://stuass.works).

## Todos
Just so you know what to be checked for on the staging app, we plan on implementing the following features
1) Organizations should be able to post a job
2) Students can apply for that Job
3) Organizations can Look up students profiles and express interest in hiring the student
4) Students and Organizations dashboards should be fully updated

The [back end API](https://github.com/Iyiola-am/saas) for all this features and more that was not mentioned above is ready, it just has not been implemented on the front end. We are hoping to do that in very soon on the `staging branch`
